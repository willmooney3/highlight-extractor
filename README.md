# highlight-extractor
Extracts freehand highlights made in PDF documents in eReaders like the
Kobo Elipsa.

# Quick Start
Install with `pip install highlight-extractor`, then run the following:

`highlight-extractor --directory /path/to/pdfs --output`

# Description
The Kobo Elipsa allows you to export highlights made in documents, as long as
those highlights are *not* made using the stylus that comes included with the
eReader. Given that reading and highlighting PDFs was the entire point of me
buying the thing, I decided to make sure my freehand highlights could be
extracted from all of the papers I read with some Python.
